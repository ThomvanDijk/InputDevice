# Input Device
This ino file is used for a real life swordfight game.

# Usage
We used this code on a Teensy++ 2.0, it is meant to make
a game where you have to hit the other player on various 
places on the body. Of course it is a reallife game
and the hits are detected by an aluminium plated sword
and aluminium plates on the players. Also the player has
to wear conducting gloves to conduct the current to the 
sword. This way you can also detect wich hand is used
so you can diable broken arms for example.
